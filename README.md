# Interstellar zkEVM

Unleash the power of the EVM on Stellar.

## High level overview

The goal of Interstellar is to integrate EVM functionality into the Stellar ecosystem. The system consists of a sequencer that batches transactions, executes state changes on an EVM, and generates a proof of computation for these changes. Both the state changes and the proof are periodically submitted to a zk-verifier contract on Soroban, ensuring finality.
